# LAVD_RCLV-Orthogonal-Parallel-Architecture
Orthogonal parallel detection of global rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices

## How to Use
1. Define the LAVD & RCLV parameters first
2. Start the process with LAVD_start.py
3. Calculate GPU-based parallel LAVD in Algorithm 1: LAVD_start.py and LAVD_SLA.py
4. Extract CPU-based parallel RCLV in Algorithm 2: RCLV_start.py and ***i4_eddy_detect_core.py (non-open source)**
