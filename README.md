# LAVD_RCLV-Orthogonal-Parallel-Architecture
Orthogonal parallel detection of global rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices


## 1. Define the LAVD & RCLV parameters first
## 2. Start the process with LAVD_start.py
## 3. Calculate GPU-based parallel LAVD in Algorithm 1: LAVD_start.py and LAVD_SLA.py
## 4. Extract CPU-based parallel RCLV in Algorithm 2: RCLV_start.py and *i4_eddy_detect_core.py (non-open source)

NOTE: It is mostly being used internally by our group and is still under development.
